First of all I learn what the tools that web development needs to write a clean code with clean command ,so I need a text editor  it mean software that i can  download and install on my pc to can write the command.

There are 3 os mac & windows & linux each of them have  a specific terminal to write a command .

in linux the command in shell help us to determine  and do   things . like what the Directory i am in by BWD command, and how create a Directory by MKdir command name 

and alot of command that help the user to move in pc between file and Directory.

every thing in our pc it is a file in many folder and i can write a code in file but can not in folder.
